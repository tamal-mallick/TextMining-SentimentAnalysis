# TextMining

I developed a model to analyze whether the subscription is canceled. To solve this problem, I used both customer data in a structured format and customer feedback received from the call center in an unstructured format. I created a TF-IDF matrix from the text data and concatenated it with the customer data. The final classification model used the concatenated data to classify whether the subscription is continued. To create the  TF-IDF matrix, I used python's NLTK platform. I have created a stacking algorithm using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and K-nearest Neighbour Classifiers. I used wrapper and filter-type feature selection methods and compared the results and chose the best one.
