# TextMining

Developed a model to analyze whether the subscription is cancelled. To solve this problem, analyzed sentiment from the customer's comments and concatenated with the customer data. The final classification model used the conactenated data to classify the whether the subscription is continued. To do the sentiment analysis, I used python's NLTK platform. Used Random forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and K-nearest Neighbour Classifiers, and Used wrapper and filter type feature selection methods to compare the the results and chose the best one.
